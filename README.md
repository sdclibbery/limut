# Limut

Live coding music and visuals in the browser. Inspired by FoxDot with a desire to make it more accessible by running in any modern browser with no installation. Approach to visuals inspired by Crash Servers `video` player.

# Documentation

Documentation (what there is of it) is available in the page itself, underneath the console.

# Try it

Please report problems / bugs / suggestions etc as github issues at https://github.com/sdclibbery/limut/issues

# Development

Run locally by firing up `./server.sh` and connecting a browser to http://localhost:8000/ . The unit tests run automatically on page load; view output in the browser console.

Limut's audio files have been copied from FoxDot (https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot), where they were obtained from a number of sources. Here's a list of thanks for the unknowing creators of FoxDot's sample archive.

    Legowelt Sample Kits
    Game Boy Drum Kit
    A number of sounds courtesy of Mike Hodnick's live coded album, Expedition
    Many samples have been obtained from http://freesound.org and have been placed in the public domain via the Creative Commons 0 License: http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ - thank you to the original creators
    Other samples have come from the Dirt Sample Engine which is part of the TidalCycles live coding language created by Yaxu - another huge amount of thanks.

If you feel I've used a sample where I shouldn't have, please get in touch!
