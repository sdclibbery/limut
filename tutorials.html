  <h1>Limut Tutorials</h1>

  <h2>About these tutorials</h2>
  <p>
    Limut is a live coding system, where you can create music and visuals live by writing code.
    These tutorials are designed to provide a gentle introduction to the concepts and syntax of limut.
  </p>
  <p>Use them by <a href="index.html" target="_blank">opening Limut in a separate tab</a>, and then copying the code snippets in. Always experiment with the snippets! Change numbers, combine multiple snippets and generally play around. Its the best way to learn.</p>
  <p>
    Under the main Limut console are various sections of documentation on Limut syntax, synths and params. They are there to be used at any time as a reference and for ideas.
    The first section of documentation contains examples ready to be copied into the Limut code editor, played, and modified.
  </p>
  <p>Further examples of live coding with Limut can be found on YouTube; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcNsl0wkXgHmJHGVCMKeWVhOSOrg7GGtx" target="_blank">for example here</a>. By following along as the code is built up, you can understand new concepts and pick up ideas.</p>

  <h2>Live coding</h2>
  <p>Lets get started; copy the following code, and paste it into the main code window in a <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Limut window</a>.</p>
  <p><code id="livecoding-1">p dbass 0024</code><button onclick="copyToClipboard('livecoding-1')" title="Copy to clipboard">üóê</button></p>
  <p>
    Then, hit the play button that looks like this: <button class="limut-button">‚ñ∂</button>. You should hear a bass riff start to play.
    To stop the music hit the stop button: <button class="limut-button">‚óº</button>.
    You can also use keyboard shortcuts; Ctrl-Enter to play and Ctrl-. to stop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike some live coding systems, in Limut pressing play runs all the code in the editor, and nothing persists apart from the code that is run.
    This means you can stop a player by deleting it or commenting it out and then hitting play. Try it now; place a <code>//</code> comment at the beginning of the line, either by typing or hitting the 'toggle comment' button <button class="limut-button">//</button>. Then hit play, and the bass will stop.
  </p>
  <p>The fullscreen button <button class="limut-button">‚õ∂</button> will make Limut go fullscreen.</p>
